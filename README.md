# PHP Multi-language Translator

I made is tool to help me create translate language package from one default language. Use for any PHP system that support muti-language and load language set from array.

Example, en.php for English

```php
/**
 * English
 */
return [
	'hi' => 'Hello',
	'bye' => 'Goodbye,
];
```
## Install & Usage

Put translator.php to your host or localhost, then declare language directory which contains language (php) files

```php
$dir = __DIR__ . '/language';
```

Finally, access translator.php from your browser üçπ
